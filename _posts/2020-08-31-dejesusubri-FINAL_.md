**Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) Breakdown at County Level**

As a measure of vulnerability during the Coronavirus pandemic, **crowding**, one of the fifteen social factors composing the *Social Vulnerability Index (SVI)*, serves as a metric to identify vulnerable US counties with high rates of **occupancy per room (PPR)**. The CDC calculates PPR at 1.5 or more persons per room, which leads to higher vulnerability of a household. This metric is particularly important during the spread of a new highly contagious infectious disease because crowding is a condition-based indicator that helps understand vulnerability at an urban and rural scale based on the National Center for Health Statistics(NCHS)/CDC classification.

**Methodology: Part 1**

As the Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) is broken down, how would focusing on a single social factor (Crowding) help understand the vulnerability of a household at a county/census tract level through the following framework?
1. SVI Vulnerability Level: 0.975-1 Level
1. SVI Crowding Vulnerability Level: 0.975-1 Level
1. National Center for Health Statistics(NCHS)/CDC classification
  * What is the classification of the most vulnerable counties?
  * What region are they located?
  * What are their characteristics?
      - Population
      - Main Industry(ies)
      - Housing typologies (Mobile Homes/Multi-Unit Structures)
1. Total household count
  * Percentage of household considered crowded (PPR: 1.5 or higher)
1. Socioeconomics
  * Poverty Levels (census tract level)

**Mapping: Overall SVI at County Level per State**

All of the counties and their overall vulnerability is being plotted in the graph above. The sizes of the circles represent the count of COVID-19 cases in the county. The data reflects the vulnerability scale that the *CDC Social Vulnerability Index (SVI)* uses to classify counties base on their individual vulnerability. It ranges from 0 tp 1.  
The map geolocates the counties that are most vulnerable based on the *overall SVI scale*. Counties that have a *vulnerability of 0.975* or higher are shown. Highlighted with the red outline are the counties with the highest vulnerability.

All of the counties and their crowding vulnerability is being plotted in the graph above. The sizes of the circles represent the share of population of each county with COVID-19.

The color combination sequences of the three graphs above use six colors to identify under which National Center for Health Statistics(NCHS)/CDC classification each county falls. The six classifications are as follows:
1. Large Metro
  * Large Central Metro (1)
  * Large Fridge Metro (2)
1. Medium Metro (3)
1. Small Metro (4)
1. Micropolitan (5)
1. Noncore (6)

**Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) Breakdown at Census Tract Level**

Understanding the underlying conditions that lead to underhoused households and crowding vulnerability is dependent on identifying the location of high concentrations of said vulnerability. The census tract breakdown will help build a more accurate picture of crowding vulnerability within a county. This data will be enhanced by satellite imagery to locate population clusters and identify some of its physical characteristics.

**Methodology: Part 2**

For this analysis, correlations between **high crowding and Covid-19 case rates** will be the main criteria taken into account when describing and comparing counties and census tracts. Urban and rural counties will be compared down to census tract level and counties with the same NCHS/CDC classification.

Site Identification:
1. Census Tract Level analysis: Breakdown of SVI
  * Using the crowding vulnerability:
      - What census tract is most vulnerable based on crowding?
      - What are the population centers within the census tract?
      - Overlapping with Covid-19 case count is data is available
1. Satellite Imagery
  * Population Clusters
      - Potential Housing Typology: The CDC considers mobile homes and multi-unit structures a point of vulnerability
      - Household composition?
      - Industry: What is the most prevent employment industry?
1. The crowding vulnerability indicators to be used include:
  * Housing type
  * Transportation mode
  * Industry
  * Covid-19 Count/Share of Population
  * Household Size
  * Household Occupancy per Room
  * Current news stories that help connect these indicators


**Counties with Highest Crowding Vulnerability**
![Overall SVI](/summer2020_research/images/crowding/All_Counties_Crowded-04.png)

The list of counties above are the most vulnerable based on the Crowding Social Factor from the Social Vulnerability Index (SVI). Four of these counties were selected to break down to the census tract level to identify where crowding vulnerability is located. As described above, **high crowding and Covid-19 case rates** were considered the main vulnerability indicators to select these counties.
