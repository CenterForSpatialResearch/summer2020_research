    <h3>This website collects a student-led publication from the Spring 2019 seminar, Conflict Urbanism: Puerto Rico Now taught by Laura Kurgan and Frances Negrón-Muntaner. This is the fourth in a series of multidisciplinary Mellon seminars at the Columbia Center for Spatial Research on the topic of Conflict Urbanism, as part of a multi-university initiative in Architecture, Urbanism and the Humanities. This Spring 2019 course focused on the role of natural and economic disaster in terms of the spatial restructuring of Puerto Rico today.</h3>

          <p class="text-left">Over the summer of 2020, researchers at the CSR investigated patterns in the distribution of COVID-19 while critically questioning the role of mapping and data visualization in understanding the pandemic. The research sought to match the COVID-19 count data at the county level with various other datasets to spatially explore patterns and trends in the spread of the virus across multiple scales.<br/><br/>While some projects prioritised an expansive approach to policy making and the distribution of key resources according to vulnerability, others zoomed into particular clusters of outbreaks in meatpacking plants and Native American reservations to elucidate long standing vulnerabilities that have been exacerbated by COVD-19. <br/><br/>The outcomes of the research demonstrate a wide variety of formats, each engaging a unique representation strategy that incorporates diagrams, maps, videos, and interactive data visualizations.<br/><br/>

<p class="text-left">The COVID-19 epidemic in the United States is not just about a virus. It’s about decades of discrimination and neglect that set up the communities hardest hit by COVID-19 for acute vulnerability to this outbreak. As we try to combat this disease, we have to think more broadly about rebuilding health from the ground up in America, in a New Deal for Public Health with a Community Health Corps that does more than just calls you up to tell you you’ve been exposed to COVID-19.<br/><br/>This website is meant to help you articulate your priorities for addressing COVID-19 and the other health threats facing your state and see how resource limitations play out based on what matters to you.<br/><br/>
